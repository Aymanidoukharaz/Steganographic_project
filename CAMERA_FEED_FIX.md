# Camera Feed Fix - Phase 2

## Issue
The PWA was successfully requesting and receiving camera permissions (showing "ACTIF" green indicator), but the camera video feed was not displaying - only a black screen appeared.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Duplicate Video Element Assignment**: The stream was being attached to the video element in multiple places (both in `useCamera.js` and `CameraView.jsx`), causing conflicts
2. **Missing iOS Safari Specific Attributes**: Required explicit attribute setting for `playsinline`, `autoplay`, and `muted`
3. **Play Promise Handling**: Insufficient error handling and retry logic for video playback
4. **State Management**: No tracking of play attempts or video errors

## Changes Made

### 1. `useCamera.js` Hook
**Simplified stream management:**
- Removed video element manipulation from the hook
- Hook now only manages the MediaStream and sets it to context
- Video element attachment is delegated to the CameraView component
- Added detailed logging for stream tracks

### 2. `CameraView.jsx` Component
**Enhanced video element handling:**
- Added `playAttemptedRef` to prevent duplicate play attempts
- Added `videoError` state for error tracking
- Explicitly set iOS Safari required attributes (`playsinline`, `autoplay`, `muted`)
- Improved play retry logic with better error messages
- Added delay before play attempt to ensure stream is fully attached
- Enhanced video element event logging (including `onPlaying`, `onSuspend`, `onStalled`)
- Added inline styles to ensure proper video display
- Display video errors in the loading overlay

### 3. Video Element Attributes
**Added iOS Safari compatibility:**
```jsx
<video
  ref={videoRef}
  autoPlay
  playsInline
  muted
  controls={false}
  webkit-playsinline="true"
  className="w-full h-full object-cover"
  style={{
    display: 'block',
    width: '100%',
    height: '100%',
    objectFit: 'cover',
    transform: 'scaleX(1)',
  }}
  // ... event handlers
/>
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Before Deployment
1. Test on iOS Safari (primary target device)
2. Verify camera feed displays correctly after permission granted
3. Check console logs for any errors during stream attachment
4. Test video playback at different network conditions

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Camera permission granted ("ACTIF" status)
- ✅ Video feed visible in viewport
- ✅ Smooth playback at 30+ FPS
- ✅ No console errors related to MediaStream
- ✅ Proper error messages if playback fails

## Deployment
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy dist/ folder to Vercel
```

## Next Steps
After confirming camera feed works:
1. Proceed to Phase 3: Computer Vision Foundation
2. Implement corner marker detection
3. Test with encoded video from Phase 1
